#Jessica Hicks - Journalism and Political Science Major# 
Hi! My name is Jessica and I am a sophomore at Lehigh University. I am an aspiring journalist and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my skill sets. I am currently an associate news editor for our student-run newspaper, the Brown and White, and served as an assistant lifestyle editor the second semester of my freshman year. This past summer I worked at Connecticut Community Foundation as a communications intern and was able to learn a lot about public relations and marketing as well. I am getting started on github as part of my visual communications class, but I am also hoping to continue using the site after I complete the course. I'm extremely ethusastic about taking this course; I believe incorporating data visualization into my studies will put me on the cutting edge of journalism and new technologies, as it will allow me to make complex stories more simple and become a more compelling storyteller in general. Most importantly, I am thrilled to be learning about something I am completely unfamiliar with. I hope you will follow me on my journey!
